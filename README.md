## Suggestions for Improvement

### Missing Project: LedgerOne
The project "LedgerOne" was mentioned as a main project but does not appear in the public repositories. Consider:
- Creating and publishing this repository if it exists privately
- Updating the main projects list if this project has been renamed or merged

### Repository Descriptions to Add or Improve
The following repositories lack descriptions and would benefit from adding them:
- **unified_query_maker**: Add a description explaining its purpose and use cases
- **Recommender_Service**: Describe the recommendation algorithms and API
- **Job_scrapper**: Document which job boards are supported and the scraping capabilities
- **network_test_suite**: Describe the types of network tests included
- **CTF**: Mention the types of challenges covered

### Main Project Selection Recommendations
Consider adding these notable projects to the main projects list:
- **Koocheh**: Has community interest (1 star) and solves a practical networking problem
- **FluidSim**: Demonstrates advanced Rust/WebAssembly skills with visual output
- **TransportationPlatform**: Showcases full microservices architecture expertise

### General Improvements
- Add topics/tags to repositories for better discoverability
- Include badges for build status, code coverage, and documentation
- Add LICENSE files to repositories that are missing them
- Create releases for mature projects to indicate stability
